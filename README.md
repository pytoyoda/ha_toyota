## About

This is a custom integration the retrieves' data from the
Toyota EU MyToyota ctpa-oneapi API and makes them available in Home Assistant as different types of sensors.
As there is no official API from Toyota, I will try my best to keep
it working, but there are no promises.

With Version 2.0.0 the toyota Custom Component only supports the new Toyota ctpa-oneapi API!
This means that this version is **no longer compatible** with your vehicle **if you are still using the old [MyT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.mytoyota.toyota.com.mytoyota) app**! Before updating, please make sure that you are already using the new [MyToyota](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toyota.oneapp.eu) app and that your vehicle has already been migrated to the new API.

**If you already have an installation of the custom component, make sure when updating to a version >= 2.0 to completely remove the previous installation from your Home Assistant devices and HACS!
You should then perform a reboot and can then reinstall the custom component via HACS again.**

## Features

Only Europe is supported.
See [here](https://github.com/widewing/ha-toyota-na) for North America.

**Disclaimer: Features available depends on your car model and year.**

### Statistics sensors

#### Important

When starting a new week, month or year, it will not show any information before your first trip. Even though a new month starts on the 1, you will need to wait for the 2 of the month before it is able to show you current month stats. This due to a limitation in Toyota API. This limitation also applies to weeks.
Due to this, this integration will list sensors as unavailable when no data is available.

#### Attributes available

**Disclaimer: Attributes available depends on your car model and year.**

All values will show `None` if no data is available for the period.

| Attribute               | Description                                                                     |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Use Home Assistant build 2023.12 or above.

If you can confirm that it is working as advertised on older version please open a PR.

**Note:** It is **_only_** tested against latest, but should work on older versions too.

**Note:** Future updates may change which version are required.

### HACS installation (Recommended)

We are still waiting for our repository to be included in the current HACS package sources (see: https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/3284).
Therefore you have to add the repository manually as an “Integration” custom repository in HACS for the time being. See also: https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/?h=add+repos

After that you can open HACS and search for `Toyota EU community integration` under integrations.
You can choose to install a specific version or from main (Not recommended).

### Manual Installation

1. Open the directory with your Home Assistant configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`,
   usually `~/.homeassistant/`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory there, you need to create it.

#### Git clone method

This is a preferred method of manual installation, because it allows you to keep the `git` functionality,
allowing you to manually install updates just by running `git pull origin main` from the created directory.

Now you can clone the repository somewhere else and symlink it to Home Assistant like so:

1. Clone the repo.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/pytoyoda/ha_toyota.git
   ```

2. Create the symlink to `toyota` in the configuration directory.
   If you have non-standard directory for configuration, use it instead.

   ```shell
   ln -s ha_toyota/custom_components/toyota ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/toyota
   ```

#### Copy method

1. Download [ZIP](https://github.com/pytoyoda/ha_toyota/archive/main.zip) with the code.
2. Unpack it.
3. Copy the `custom_components/toyota/` from the unpacked archive to `custom_components`
   in your Home Assistant configuration directory.

### Integration Setup

- Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
- In the sidebar click on [Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config).
- From the configuration menu select: [Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations).
- In the bottom right, click on the [Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=toyota) button.
- From the list, search and select “Toyota Connected Services”.
- Follow the instruction on screen to complete the set-up.
- After completing, the Toyota Connected Services integration will be immediately available for use.

## Contribution

Contributions are more the welcome. This project uses `poetry` and `pre-commit` to make sure that
we use a unified coding style throughout the code. Poetry can be installed by running `poetry install`.
Please run `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files` and make sure that all tests passes before
opening a PR or committing to the PR. All PR's must pass all checks for them to get approved.
